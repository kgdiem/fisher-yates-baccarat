# Baccarat 
Baccarat (/ˈbækəræt/ or /bɑːkəˈrɑː/; French: [bakaʁa]) is a card game played at casinos. There are three popular variants of the game: punto banco (or "North American baccarat"), baccarat chemin de fer (or "chemmy"),[1] and baccarat banque (or "à deux tableaux"). In Punto banco each player's moves are forced by the cards the player is dealt. 

Baccarat is a comparing card game played between two hands, the "player" and the "banker". Each baccarat coup (round of play) has three possible outcomes: "player" (player has the higher score), "banker", and "tie".

# Fisher-Yates
The Fisher–Yates shuffle is an algorithm for generating a random permutation of a finite sequence—in plain terms, the algorithm shuffles the sequence. The algorithm effectively puts all the elements into a hat; it continually determines the next element by randomly drawing an element from the hat until no elements remain. The algorithm produces an unbiased permutation: every permutation is equally likely. The modern version of the algorithm is efficient: it takes time proportional to the number of items being shuffled and shuffles them in place.

# Why Baccarat and Fisher-Yates
I like Baccarat and the shuffling machines used at casinos utilize the Fisher-Yates algorithm. Simple enough!
